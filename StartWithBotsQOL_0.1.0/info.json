    Have experience using BOTs from the beginning of gameplay! 
    
    Start the game with:
     - Roboport modified with an insane range
     - 200 fusion construction bots
     - An insane Fusion Reactor so your armor will never get out of energy.
    
    This mod is based on the `FasterStart` from @magu5026 and `NibblesQualityofLife` from @DarthNibbles."
