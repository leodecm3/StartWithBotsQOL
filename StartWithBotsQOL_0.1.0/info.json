Have experience of using BOTs fom the begining of gameplay! 

Start the game with:
 - Roboport modified with a insane range
 - 200 fusion construction bots
 - A insane Fusion Reactor so your armor will never get out of energy.

This mod is based on the `FasterStart` from @magu5026 and and `NibblesQualityofLife` from @DarthNibbles."
